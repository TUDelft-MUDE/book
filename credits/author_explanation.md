DRAFT TEXT of email from Robert to MUDE authors:

The most important thing is to let us know if you think the way we are describing your chapter is appropriate, and to make any corrections you think are necessary. Below the part about your chapter is also an explanation about the book as a whole: while we think that part is nearly final, feedback is still very much welcome!

Kind regards,
Robert, Tom and Sandra




At the end of the book, the following text will be included:

Chapter <title> is written by <authors>. Special thanks goes to <name> for <contribution>.

On the first page of a chapter, the following text will be included 

> This Chapter is written by `<Primary Authors>`. Find out more here.

The "Find out more here" link will point to the Credits page of the book, which will be a list of all authors and their contributions, including the text shown above.



The book, in its current form, was first used in the 2023-24 academic year. Although there were several authors that made great contributions, it was Tom, Sandra and I that were looking more at the overall structure and flow of the book. As such, we propose to be listed as Editors, but acknowledge the contributions of other authors and collaborators in the specific chapters where their effort was concentrated. The following text illustrates how the entire book will be described on the Credits page:

=====================

The introduction, structure of the book and formatting of contents is done under direction of the Editors (Robert Lanzafame, Tom van Woudenberg and Sandra Verhagen), in collaboration with a large team of co-authors and student assistants. Some chapters and pages have additional primary authors who are identified within the book either at the bottom of the first page in a chapter, or at the bottom of an individual page, as necessary. If an author is not listed on a particular chapter or page, the editors may be attributed as the authors.

You can refer to individual chapters or pages within this book as:

_Individual chapters/pages will be listed on this page as well, as described at the beginning of this email for each particular case._
