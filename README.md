Happy book building!

There are several directories:

- `book/`: primary source files for the book
- `code/`: auxiliary scripts for generating figures, etc. These are executed via eval-rst blocks, but the functionality is disabled for now.
- `unused/`: files that were removed from the book. Might be better to hide these in a branch unused/pd/
