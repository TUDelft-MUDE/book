## Bivariate damage 

Consider two damages $(X,Y)$ instead of one. In this case the (smoothed) risk curve becomes a risk surface (Figure 3). 




A common representation of a bivariate risk surface is presented in Table 3. The information in Table 3, which in turn is a summary of Figure 3, can be represented by triples $〈x_i,y_j,P_{i,j} 〉$ where $P_{i,j}=P(X≥x_i  ∩ Y≥y_j  )$.

|       | $y_1$ | $y_2$ | $...$ | $y_{N-1}$| $y_{N}$ |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| $x_1$ |$P_{1,1}$ |$P_{1,2}$|$...$| $P_{1,N-1}$|$P_{1,N}$|
| $x_2$ |$P_{2,1}$ |$ P_{2,2}$| $...$ |       |       |
|    ⋮  |  ⋮     | ⋮      |  ⋮     |  ⋮     | ⋮      |
|$x_{N-1}$|$P_{N-1,1}$|$P_{N-1,2}$| $...$ |       |       |
| $x_{N}$ |  $P_{N,1}$|$P_{N,2}$| $...$ |$P_{N,N-1}$|$P_{N,N}$|

## Multivariate damage 

When more than two damages are considered, the risk curve becomes a risk surface over a multidimensional space. In that case, an intuitive graphical representation as in Figure 3 is not possible anymore and a tabular representation becomes also inconvenient. However, the $(m+1)$-tuple representation is still a good way to summarize multivariate damages as $\langle x_{1,i_1}, x_{2,i_2}, \ldots, x_{m,i_m}, P_{i_1,i_2,\ldots,i_m} \rangle$. Notice that in this case $P_{i_1,i_2,\ldots,i_m} = P(X_1 \geq x_{1,i_1}, X_2 \geq x_{2,i_2}, \ldots, X_m \geq x_{m,i_m})$.


In the construction that we have followed so far, we are interested in the joint exceedance probability. However, remember that OR probabilities might also be of interest. For example, if we would be interested in at leas one X_i exceeding a certain damage level.
