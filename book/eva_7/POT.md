# Peak Over Threshold (POT)

The second technique for sampling extremes is Peak Over Threshold (POT). This technique consists of selecting the **excesses over a defined threshold** with a minimum distance between them. Thus, it involves defining two parameters: the threshold, and the declustering time (minimum time/distance between two extreme observations). Note that when performing EVA with POT, we model the excesses over the threshold, not the actual value of the extreme event.

Let's apply it to our time series. We are going to use a threshold $th = 2.5m$ and a declustering time $dl = 48h$. This is, we will select the values higher than 2.5m that have a 'distance' between them of at least 48h. In the figure below, you can see how the application of this method looks like.

```

We can see in the figure a concentration of extremes during the first months of 1991 and 1992, even if we have set $dl = 48h$. This means that there were several storms in the beginning of the year. When comparing POT with Block Maxima (see Figure below), we can see that more extremes are sampled using POT. The main disadvantage of Block Maxima is derived from its simplicity: only one maxima is sampled in each block. Thus, there may be other extreme observations (storms in this example) which are not sampled within the same block. Consequently, a higher number of extremes is usually sampled when using POT, although its application is a bit more complicated, as we will see in the following sections. For instance, in our example we obtained 20 extreme observations when applying Yearly Maxima (20 years of observations), while we sampled 54 extreme observations when using POT.

## Advantages and considerations for use

We already saw that POT extracts more information from the time series (higher number of extremes sampled), being that a great advantage when working with short time series. However, its implementation is a bit more tricky.

The results of our analysis are dependent on the parameters we select. For instance, if $th$ is too low, I will be including in the analysis events which cannot be considered extremes. On the other hand, if $th$ is too high, I will be losing information and, thus, not taking advantage of all the power that POT has. In the following sections, we will see the hypothesis that an appropriate $th$ and $dt$ need to fulfill. However, as a rule of thumb, we can start the analysis using $th \approx 90-99$ percentile of our observations.

When introducing the concept of $RT$, we saw that one of the basic assumptions of EVA was that extremes are independent and identically distributed (*iid* conditions). This implies that when sampling our extremes, we need to ensure that they are independent. At this point is where POT requires a bit more work than Block Maxima: we need to select $dl$ so we ensure that the sampled observations are independent. Let's elaborate it a bit more.

A storm is a phenomenom which lasts several hours, so if we take a look at the time series of hourly $H_s$ during a storm (see Figure below) we see how registered $H_s$ goes up, stays around the maximum values for a while and, later, goes down. Therefore, we can say that there is a concentration of extreme values in the storms. For instance, there are 5 observations in a row above $th = 2.5m$. However, these extremes are caused by the same drivers and are thus dependent. If we included all of them in our EVA analysis, we would be violating the basic assumption of EVA of *iid* extremes. This phenomenom of concentration of extremes in time is called **clustering**: we say that extremes cluster in time, since an extreme phenomenom is not composed by a single observation.

And there is where $dl$ joins the party! If we ensure that the sampled extremes are far enough from each other in time ($dl$ big enough), we can make sure that they do not belong to the same storm, so we can consider them independent. The needed $dl$ depends on the physical phenomena which drive the extreme event that we are analyzing and the local conditions. For instance, an appropriate $dl$ for wave analysis can range from few hours to 72h, since storm duration depends on the local conditions.

Advantages:
- Usually a higher number of sampled extremes. Thus, it is appropriate for shorter time series.
- Appropriate when there's no clear seasonality in the extremes (physical insight in the phenomenom).

Disadvantages:
- Further analysis required to ensure that the sampled extremes are *iid*.
- Further computations needed, so the process is slower.

## Let's code it

In order to exemplify how to actually implement POT,pseudo code is presented.

### Pseudo code

    read observations

    th = 2.5
    dl = 48 #in hours

    excesses = (peaks in observations > th with distance >= dl) - th #we model the excesses over the threshold

## Let's practice

A scientist wants to analyze the extreme concentrations of nitrous oxide ($N_2O$) in the atmosphere as it is listed as one of the greenhouse gases to consider when assessing climate change. The scientist has a timeseries of 10 years. Which sampling method for extremes should he/she apply?

```{admonition} Answer
:class: tip, dropdown

As the scientist has a short timeseries for characterizing extremes (only 10 years), he/she should apply a method which maximizes the information extracted from the data. If the scientist applies BM with a time block of one year, only 10 observations are sampled, which is very little information to quantify the distribution of extremes. Thus, the scientist should apply POT.

Another option would be to apply BM with a time block of a **smaller size** sampling then, for instance, the monthly maxima. Note that then the fitted GEV will provide the **monthly** non-exceedance probabilities.
