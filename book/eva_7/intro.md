# Extreme Value Analysis

A thorough understanding of Extreme Value Analysis (EVA) is important for properly assessing the extreme conditions that may act on an structure or system during its design lifetime. In the following chapters, the formal concept of extreme will be introduced, as well as the techniques to sample them without a dataset and probabilistically analyze them. At the end of this chapters, you can also find some supplementary videos, in case you prefer that format.
