In this section, you will be introduced to the basic concepts related to modelling.\
It is split into four sections. Each section aims to enable you to discuss and answer the following questions, respectively:
- What is a model and which types of models can be built?
- How do I choose the appropriate model?
- How do I know that a model is accurate?
- How can I assess model performance?
