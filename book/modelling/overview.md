# Modelling

In this section, you will be introduced to the basic concepts related to modelling. The chapter is split into four sections, with the aim of each to enable you to discuss and answer the following questions, respectively:
- What is a model and which types of models can be built?
- How do I choose the appropriate model?
- How do I know that a model is accurate?
- How can I assess model performance?

These concepts are generally useful to reflect on all topics with MUDE and many branches of engineering.
