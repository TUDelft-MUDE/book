# Welcome to the MUDE Textbook

Welcome to the MUDE textbook for the 2023-24 academic year. This is where assigned reading is located, along with interactive exercises to practice and study the module material.

````{admonition} Interactive Pages---Use Python in your Browser!
    
This online textbook has a number of pages that are set up to be used interactively. You can use the "Live Code" button under the Rocket Ship icon in the top right to activate the interactive features and use Python interactively!

Sometimes the interactivity will involve completing an exercise, wheras on other pages it might simply provide the opportunity to edit the contents of code cells and execute it to explore the page contents interactively. Other pages may provide interactive figures (e.g., widgets).

This feature is supported by [TeachBooks](http://teachbooks.tudelft.nl/).
