# Welcome to the MUDE Textbook

Welcome to the MUDE textbook. This is where assigned reading is located, along with interactive exercises to practice and study the module material.

Content in this textbook will be added throughout the semester, and changes will be announced and documented as needed. When new content is added, it will be done in large chunks. Changes will not be made retroactively that impact the scope of the exams (in other words, you will never need to re-study material because it changed prior to the exam). Notifications of errors, corrections and suggestions for improvement are glady welcomed via the Answers platform and/or via the MUDE email address.



````{admonition} A Note about Notation
    
A more thorough notation page will be included in the material for week 3 and 4. For now, we would like to inform you about the following conventions for the Propagation of Uncertainty Chapter (2):
- Random variables use an italic upper case letter for the variable, and a lower case letter for a realization of that random variable
- Vectors of random variables (random vectors) are columns (m x 1), and use a upper case, italicized letter
- Matrix of random variables uses upper case, non-italicized letters (same as random vectors)
- Deterministic vectors use a lower case, non-italicized letter
- Deterministic matrices use upper case, non-italicized letters

````{admonition} Interactive Pages---Use Python in your Browser!
    
This online textbook has a number of pages that are set up to be used interactively. On such pages you can use the "Live Code" button under the Rocket Ship icon in the top right to activate the interactive features and use Python interactively!

Sometimes the interactivity will involve completing an exercise, wheras on other pages it might simply provide the opportunity to edit the contents of code cells and execute it to explore the page contents interactively. Other pages may provide interactive figures (e.g., widgets).

This is a new feature that we are actively working to incorporate in the MUDE textbook, so please provide us feedback via the [Answers platform](https://answers.citg.tudelft.nl/) if things go well or you have suggestions for improvement.
