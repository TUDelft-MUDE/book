# Welcome to the MUDE Textbook

Welcome to the MUDE textbook.

_this is where stuff will be written later_

````{admonition} Update for MUDE Teachers
:class: note
I got rid of the README that used to be here, because you should have your workflow set by now, and you should know by now that you can always check it on GitLab [here](https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/mude/book/). **I'll put recent updates here for the 2 weeks leading up to the start of Q1**:
- Draft of Programming Part is ready---the first content for the "new" book to be placed! Note that it is located in `book/book/programming`.
- As you finalize the ToC for your material, move it to the same level directory as the programming part. All Parts should be a sub-directory of `book`.
- By the start of Q1, all material in `cookbook`, `old`, `sandbox` should be removed, moved or hidden (preferably by YOU!)
- **Aug 24**: draft ToC prepared for afternoon collaboration session.

Table of Contents notes (can turn into text on this page later):
- Modeling is a clear topic and has it's own part. Q2 topics are separated though, at least for this year
- Modeling can be both the model (and it's underlying mathematics) as well as conceptual processes. Both are very applicatble to  
- Data is difficult to separate from modeling, probability and statistics topics, so it doesn't have it's own heading
- Uncertainty is far too broad a topic, so we instead rely on sub-topics like probability, statistics, observation theory, error propagation, etc
- "Uncertainty and Data" are especially difficult to extract from each other
- Modeling and Probability parts cover weeks 1.1, 1.2, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8 (partial)
  - 2.1: FVM
  - 2.2: FEM
  - 2.3
  - 2.7-2.8: Risk & Reliability (also may be used partially in 1.7-1.8)


````{admonition} Dicatorial Proclamation by the MUDE Manager
:class: warning
The MUDE content formerly known as **coding** shall henceforth be called **programming.**

Don't like it? Too bad, maybe you can become manager next year and change it back. I have plenty of reasons, but rather than type them I believe they are better discussed over a cold beverage.

Right now, the home page of the book simply displays `README.md` which is located at `./book/` or you can [read on GitLab here](https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/mude/book/-/blob/main/README.md).
