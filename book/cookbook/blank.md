# Cookbook

This Part of the book is a collection point for various instructions and examples. In particular, the following chapters lay out two types of interactive features:
1. non-code examples (e.g., how to make different types of quiz questions)
2. code examples. This is brand new and unique to MUDE; it is now possible to run Python code directly in the book!

Especially for type 2, there is a lot of potential for providing immediate feedback to students when they run a code cell, but this is not documented extensively yet. **For those developing educational content:** if you know how you want to implement a particular type of question in your book, *send Robert a description as soon as possible!* For example, "I want to have students write a function to implement method A, and when they run the code cell they see if it gives the right answer. It will be checked by confirming a few inputs and outputs of the function, but I don't want the students to see the correct answer (values nor function code)."

_This book temporarily supercedes the Cookbook in our other (non-MUDE) book (links to: [website](https://interactivetextbooks.citg.tudelft.nl/) and [repo](https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/interactivetextbooks-citg/jupyter-book-manual)). Prior to Q1 starting, the content here will be moved o the other book._

Remember to visit the [Jupyter Book website](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/) for basic functionality, and create a GitLab issue if you still have problems or questions.
