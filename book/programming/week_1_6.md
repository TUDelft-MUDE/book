# Week 1.6: Errors

At this point you are used to the fact that bugs in your code are a fact of life, but probably don't have a methodical way of dealing with them. Perhaps sometimes you get errors and and have no idea how to fix them. This week we will consider various _error types_ and promote a structured approach to debugging by learning about the _traceback_ feature in Python.
