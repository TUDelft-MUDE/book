# Code 

text. Matlab also high level and multi-purpose like Python.

Things that will definitely go here:
- functions (a brief overview/highlight of features, then link to the object part of programs)
- complexity: where does it come from and why is it important (work backwards to know which concepts need to be included (e.g., bits and flops etc)); can find good reference rather than repeat chapters of numerical analysis textbook material

## Python language

There are some things included here, but we will need much more

## Packages

**package** defined

there are many sources. common ones are PyPI and conda forge

We can also have local packages! we will learn about those later

### Installing Packages

How to install packages

Use conda. Always do it this way:

```{admonition}
code
```


A bit of a note about packages/modules and methods, with example of `matplotlib.pyplot` and a method.

```{note}
you may ave used pip install in the past, but it's not good practice since it can mess with your stuff...
```
