# Overview of Programming Topics

Programming topics will be added on a weekly basis, and this page will be used to summarize the weekly topics. See the overview page for each week for a detailed list of topics and learning objectives.

Remember that the scope of the programming assignmentes defines what will be tested on the exam. Although the reading in this book is useful for learning the concepts, you are not expected to reproduce all of it; rather, you should be able to recall key concepts that are essential for performing the tasks in MUDE assignments.

Summary of weekly topics:

- Week 1.1:
  - Computers and (Computing) Environments
  - Software Installation 
  - Files and Folders
  - Python Warmup
