# Gurobi Optimization Software

Gurobi is an optimization software that consists of two parts:

1. A closed-source optimizer software that can be installed on your computer and requires a license (an academic license is free).
2. An open-source Python package that acts as an _interface_ to the optimizer, allowing analysis to be run and interpreted using Python.

Once both tools are installed, it is then easy to use the Gurobi optimizer via an easy-to-use interface, for example: Jupyter notebooks.

The following pages illustrate how to install and use Gurobi; the former is covered in Week 2.4, the latter in Week 2.5.
