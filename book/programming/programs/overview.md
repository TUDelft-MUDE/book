# Programs 

text. Can briefly mention programming paradigms and that we focus on object-oriented and functional. FORTRAN was old standard in engineering, which is declarative. 

Things that will definitely go here:
- Objects
  - theory: what it is, why it's useful
  - Case studies: interactive pages that focus on variables, functions, figures as objects
- Modular programming workshop
  - importing py files
  - connection to how packages function (explore with interactive features)
- Writing efficient programs for numerical analysis
  - add theory missing from Code chapter
  - explicit case studies illustrating best practices
  - examples that quantitatively show the effect of bad practices
  - e.g., sparse matrices, for loops and why they should be avoided
