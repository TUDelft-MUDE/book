# Programming, Week 1.1: Getting Started!

The purpose of this week is to get software installed and be prepared to work with Python code and Jupyter Notebooks.

There are also some programming "theory" pages to help you understand what you are doing with the MUDE software stack, and why we use particular tools. A brief introduction to Computers and Computing Environments is provided before the software installation instructions. Once the software is ready, you are able to read and implement the information in the File System and Pyhton Warmup sections:

- Files System: an explanation and practice for setting up a MUDE working directory
- Python Warmup: in this section we use a Jupyter Notebook to briefly review and practice with dictionaries, a fundamental Python data type that is _extremely_ useful, but you probably don't remember from prior courses.

The software installation pages guide you through the process for installing several tools that we will use on a daily basis in MUDE. A brief overview is provided here:
- Miniconda: a software distribution that includes:
  - the Python programming language (we will use version 3.12)
  - Conda (or `conda`): an environment manager
  - a few other tools to make things go smoothly, for example the Python package manager `pip`
- Visual Studio Code (abbreviated VS Code or VSC):
  - this is our Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of choice becuase of its ease-of-use, flexibility and collaboration features
  - note that VSC is an alternative to Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab IDE's, which you may have used in the past
- Jupyter: a Python-based software
  - Note that Jupyter Notebooks are a file format (extension `*.ipynb`), and Jupyter Notebook is also an IDE
  - We will install Jupyter in our computing environment using `conda` and interact with the Jupyter Notebook `*.ipynb` files using VSC as our IDE

Don't forget to look at the subpages of the {ref}`Install Miniconda <install-miniconda>` page: there are some useful tips for dealing with {ref}`Hidden Files and Folders <hidden>`, {ref}`Command Line Interface (CLI) <cli>` and {ref}`Setting Environment Variables on Windows <env-vars-windows>`!
```

```{note}
If you are not familiar with Jupyter notebooks you should spend some time getting comfortable; hopefully you have a patient group member that is willing to show you a few tricks. Even for those who have used them before, if you are unfamiliar with VS Code you will need a few minutes to get used to the slightly different interface.
