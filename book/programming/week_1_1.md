# Programming, Week 1.1: Getting Started!

The purpose of this week is to get software installed and be prepared to work with Python code and Jupyter Notebooks.

Programming Concepts:
- Computers and Computing Environments
- The files system: explanation and practice for setting up a MUDE working directory
- Dictionaries: a fundamental Python data type that is _extremely_ useful, but you probably don't remember from prior courses

Software installation:
- Miniconda: `conda` environment manager, which includes Python (we will use version 3.12)
- Our IDE of choice is VS Code
- Jupyter Notebooks (via a `conda` environment)


Nite: if you are not familiar with Jupyter notebooks you should spend some time getting comfortable; hopefully you have a patient group member that is willing to show you a few tricks. Even for those who have used them before, if you are unfamiliar with VS Code you will need a few minutes to get used to the slightly different interface.
