# Probability




In a separate chapter, we focus on key concepts for applying probability to engineering problems, where our fundamental tools will be continuous distributions and related concepts: probability density function (PDF), cumulative distribution function (CDF), empirical distributions.

## Probability Theory

Fundamental probability concepts are a pre-requisite for this course, and a small amount of material is provided in the Fundamentals chapter, for example:
- Axioms and rules of probability,
- Random variable, introduced with the Gaussian (or Normal) distribution

It is important to recognize that this material is not a replacement for a complete BSc-level course in probability and statistics! While we try to explain key concepts throughout the course materials, you should refer to an appropriate textbook if something is unclear, or if you desire further explanation or mathematical proofs. You have also available the [online course](https://tudelft-citg.github.io/learn-probability/intro_in_toc.html) we prepared for you.
