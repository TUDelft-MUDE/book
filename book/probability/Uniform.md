# Uniform distribution

The uniform distribution is the simplest type of continuous parametric distribution and, as it is implied in its name, the PDF has a constant value along a given interval $[a,b]$, where $a < b$. The PDF of the uniform is given by

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{b-a}   \hspace{1cm}   \text{for} \ a\leq x \leq b
$$

$$
f(x) = 0  \hspace{1cm} \text{otherwise}
$$

Note that all values in the distribution are between the lower limit $a$ and the higher limit $b$ and are equally likely to occur. The left pannel of the figure below, shows an example of a uniform PDF with $a=-1$ and $b=1$.

As seen in previous chapters, the CDF is the integral of the PDF. Thus, as we integrate over a constant, the CDF presents a linear shape, as shown in the right pannel of the figure above. Thus, the CDF is given as

$$
F(x) = 0   \hspace{1cm}   \text{for} \ x<a
$$

$$
F(x) = \frac{x-a}{b-a}   \hspace{1cm}   \text{for} \ a\leq x \leq b
$$

$$
F(x) = 1  \hspace{1cm} \text{for} \ x>b
$$

If we make $a=0$ and $b=1$, we obtain the standard or unity uniform distribution, which is used to generate random values from other distribution functions for simulation purposes.

## Some properties

The mean of the uniform distribution can be computed based on its simple geometry as

$
E[X]=\frac{1}{2}(a+b)
$

The variance is given by

$
Var[X] = \frac{1}{12}(b-a)^2
$

Finally, note that uniform distribution is symmetric and presents 0 skewness. Thus, the median and the mean are identical. This is, it does not present any tail.
