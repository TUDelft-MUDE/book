Unfortunately, using Explicit Euler in this case is useless as it will make the problem unstable for any time step (to be tested in the workshop). The physical reason why this combination worked fine with the diffusion equation is that diffusivity occurs in all directions (elliptic, parabolic problem depending on unsteadiness), but for advection (hyperbolic equation) information mainly comes from upstream (the direction of information propagation), so it is not logical to have equal weights from contiguous volumes to define the flux of $\\phi$! It should be more relevant the quantity coming from upstream. \n",

    "Note that the matrix in the above example contains a lot of zeros: 10 out of 36 elements are non-zero (28%). This is called a _sparse_ matrix, and the proportion of non-zero entries grows with the size of the problem. For example, $N=1000$ finite volumes requires $2N-2$ non-zero entries (1998), which is only 0.1% of the matrix! Since matrix calculations are computationally expensive, we would never carry out the matrix calculations as represented here. Instead, various vectorization approaches are implemented in all numerical analysis software packages. Typically, a mapping of volumes and coordinates are stored in a vector format that retains the relationship between volumes and the interpolation points (e.g., neighbor volumes). Then calculations per volume are carried out using this vectorized information. This can be easily implemented in any programming language, for example, with a for loop over each volume. However, note that as geometry of the domain of interest and the discretization scheme changes (e.g., non-square volumes!) more advanced vectorization techniques are required."
