Establishing a relationship between the Lagrangian and Eulerian frames, was the first step to the FVM. Now, let us see how the Lagrangian derivative can allow one to express the **fundamental conservation laws** in a manner that is consistent with the FVM.  

Consider the infinitesimally small finite volume shown below (in 3D):

The height of the volume is shown as $\delta y$. You are in an Eulerian frame observing the volume through which a fluid is only flowing in and out along the $y$ axis. It enters through the bottom face and leaves through the top face. The velocity of the fluid at the center of the cube is simply the $y$ component of the velocity, $v$.

Now, recall Gaussâ€™s theorem (check again that chapter if needed!). The change in mass inside this volume is simply the difference of the mass flux through the surfaces. As the first step, let us calculate this flux. We have the **velocity at the centre of the cell**, how can one get the **velocity on the top and bottom faces** using this information?

If you thought of interpolation, then you are correct! One can write the flux on the top face (velocity normal to the face times the area):

$$\begin{gather*}(\rho v)_{top}=(\rho v)_{center}+\frac{\partial(\rho v)_{center}}{\partial y}\frac{\delta y}{2}\\(\rho v)_{bottom}=(\rho v)_{center}-\frac{\partial(\rho v)_{center}}{2}\frac{\delta y}{2}\end{gather*}$$

Next the mass inside the cell variation with time is simply:

$$\left|\frac{\partial(\rho_{center}\delta x\delta y\delta z)}{\partial t}\right| = \frac{\partial\rho_{center}}{\partial t}(\delta x\delta y\delta z)$$

where $\rho$ is the density of the fluid (the volume of the cell remains unchanged at the center of the cell). Note, however, that its value is not constant and, therefore, **Gauss's theorem** dictates:

$$\frac{\partial\rho_{center}}{\partial t}(\delta x\delta y\delta z)=(\rho v)_{bottom}(\delta x\delta z)-(\rho v)_{top}(\delta x\delta z)$$

The signs for top and bottom here are as follows - a flux into the cell is positive and a flux leaving the cell is negative. From the above expressions, one obtains (after dropping the "center" subscript):

$$\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t}=-\frac{\partial(\rho v)}{\partial y}$$

Extending to 3D and 3 components of flux, one can generalise the above equation as:

$$\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t}=-\frac{\partial(\rho u)}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial(\rho v)}{\partial y}-\frac{\partial(\rho w)}{\partial z}$$

or using the vector notation

$$\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t}+\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot(\rho\mathbf{v})=0$$

Let us expand the operator $\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot(\rho\mathbf{v})$ using the chain rule:

$$\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot(\rho\mathbf{v})=\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t}+\rho\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot\mathbf{v}+(\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{\nabla})\rho=0$$

Look at the above equation carefully. Do the first and the third term together match something that we spoke of before this section? You are correct if you guessed that they represent the Lagrangian derivative. So, the equation ultimately reads:

$$\frac{D\rho}{Dt}+\rho\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot\mathbf{v}=0$$

This is the conservation law for mass, i.e. mass can neither be created nor destroyed *(classic mechanics)*

## A general conservation law?

The equation

$$\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t}+\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot(\rho\mathbf{v})=0$$

can be generalised to represent the conservation of any property that is known to be conserved. Let us start by writing

$$\frac{\partial(\rho\phi)}{\partial t}+\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot(\rho\phi\mathbf{v})$$

Upon expanding the two terms using the chain rule, one obtains:

$$\phi\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t}+\rho\frac{\partial\phi}{\partial t}+\phi\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot(\rho\mathbf{v})+\rho(\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{\nabla})\phi$$

Now combine the terms to rewrite the equation as:

$$\phi\left[\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t}+\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot(\rho\mathbf{v})\right]+\rho\left[\frac{\partial\phi}{\partial t}+(\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{\nabla})\phi\right]$$

We know that the term in with the square brackets on the left is zero (*why?*), whereas the term on within the square brackets on the right is the Lagrangian derivative of $\phi$. So, one can simply write:

$$\rho\frac{D\phi}{Dt}=\frac{\partial(\rho\phi)}{\partial t}+\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot(\rho\phi\mathbf{v})$$
