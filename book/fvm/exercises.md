# Exercises

Consider the same advection case introduced on the previous page in 2D, where the domain has been discretized into 12 finite volumes, as illustrated below.

Finite volume discretization for 2D advection exercise.
```

Assume that the $x$ and $y$ components of the velocity field are both equal to $c$. Formulate the FVM for the 2D case by finding the following:
1. Equation for $\phi_i^{n+1}$ for finite volume $i$, discretized with central difference (space) and forward Euler (time) schemes.
2. Define the system of equations for all 12 volumes by writing out the matrix and vector terms.
