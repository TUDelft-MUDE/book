    "So far we have used a Cartesian coordinate system to define the algebraic expressions. However, complex geometries cannot be represented accurately in such coordinate system. One advantage of the Finite Volume Method is its suitability for complex geometries, such as structured curvilinear meshes and specially for unstructured meshes. **It is important to mention that FDM can also be adapted to such meshes but it is more complicated to implement it.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The essence of the Finite Volume Method is the conservation of a quantity by interpreting the influence of physical mechanisms as fluxes through the surfaces of a defined volume. That quantity is defined at the centroid and is representative of the entire volume. Rectangular shapes were used to illustrate a 1D convection problem but any shape can be used, \"two\" dimensions shapes (it is still a volume by assuming a uniform depth of the 2D shapes) like rectangles, triangles, pentagons, hexagons or non-regular shapes. It is evident that the number of surfaces with possible fluxes is different in every shape.\n",

    "\n",
    "For a mesh composed only of equilateral triangles, just like for the metal with a cut of 60 degrees, the line connecting the centroids of two contiguous volumes aligns with the normal vector of the surfaces, this volumes are said to be orthogonal. However, if this is not the case, then the mesh is referred to as non-orthogonal. In practice, having a perfectly orthogonal mesh is too restrictive and a degree of non-orthogonality (non-uniform) is needed to represent complex geometries. A correction is needed! \n",

    "is computed with the information of the location points $1,2$ and the values $\\phi_{V1},\\phi_{V2}$ and $\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial s}$ requires the location points $a,b$ and the values $\\phi_{a},\\phi_{b}$. So we need to approximate the value of $\\phi$ at the vertices! This last computation is specially costly and adds a potential error. Also, note that the intersection between the line connecting the centroids and the surface is not the midpoint of the surface, so the accuracy is reduced as consequence. These reasons highlight the importance of keeping the non-orthogonality of the mesh limited as much as possible.\n"
