# Final short summary

To summarise this chapter more holistically:

* The FVM is convenient for solving problems related to fluid mechanics
* The approach is similar to the FDM but now we solve an integral form of the differential equation
* Time-based problems will require a stability analysis regardless of the method used (FVM/FDM)

The **mathematical concepts** that you have learnt:

* Gaussâ€™s theorem for converting the divergence operator into a surface integral
* Lagrangian derivative that helps use information obtained in a Eulerian frame, which is the norm in fluid mechanics and simulation.
* The general form of the conservation law for any physical quantity 
* How one can use the general conservation law to derive any fundamental conservation equation (mass, momentum and energy) for a fluid in continuum without having to remember the equations themselves.
* Discretisation over a finite volume and obtaining fluxes and face parameters.

```{note} Final remarks

The FVM is a powerful method, without which, any design that has something to do with fluid cannot be realised. The method is based on conservation law and hence, is fundamental and versatile and therefore, is found in applications from fluid mechanics to electromagnetism!
