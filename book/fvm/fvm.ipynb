This is illustrated for a 2D example illustrated in {numref}`fvm3`, for volume $i$, $j$. In this case the $x$ and $y$ axes are sub-divided into increments $\\Delta x$ and $\\Delta y$.

        "As seen in other chapters of this textbook, to solve PDE's numerically, values of the function of interest at several discrete points in $\\mathbf{x}$ are required to formulate and computing numerical differentiation and integration schemes (in space _and_ time). However, as illustrated in {numref}`fvm2` and {numref}`fvm3`, the finite volume discretization uses only a single central point to represent the quantity of interest. Therefore, the finite volume method requires use of neighboring volumes in the numerical schemes. As the conservation laws require $\\mathbf{u}$ to be balanced at the boundaries of every finite volume, this forms an ideal point at which to make computations. The boundary of a standard finite volume is thus divided into four faces, North, South, East, West (abbreviated N, S, E, W), as illustrated in {numref}`fvm4`, and $\\mathbf{u}$ is computed at each face, typically as an average using the neighboring volumes.\n",

However, whereas the FVM uses each point to represent the _center_ of a finite volume, FDM uses the points as corners of square units in a grid. Unlike FDM, FVM uses surface fluxes, computed at the boundary of each finite volume; these points are located between the evaluation points of the FDM grid. In addition, FVM integrates over the volumes prior to applying numerical integration schemes, whereas FDM uses numerical differentiation to discretize the PDE's. This gives a very important advantage to the FVM: quantities are conserved! This is not ensured while using FDM.\n",
