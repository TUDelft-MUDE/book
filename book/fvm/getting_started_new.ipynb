    "This is a very quick overview of some fundamental knowledge that is helpful for understanding the analytic and numeric work needed for FVM. Some of it is calculus and continuum mechanics that should be mostly review (and can be used as a reference for notation), whereas the later sections give some context and insight into the derivation of commonly used conservation laws (PDE's) that can be solved using FVM. A few selected LaTeX equations are provided as well to help you use the same notation in your Markdown-formatted reports (optional)."
