# git

```{note}
The `git` workshop was closely integrated with the Q1 project from this week; for a more complete description see: {ref}`code-1-3`
```

The original workshop used the terminal (git bash) to introduce `git`. However, after many students were struggling to catch up with the coding workshops from Week 1.1, a simplified version was given which required only using the web browser to make a commit to a repository, which was required for the Q1 project that week.

:download:`GitLab Tutorial <../week-1-3/GitLab_Tutorial.pdf>`
```

```{eval-rst}
:download:`GitLab Tutorial Simplified <../week-1-3/GitLab_Tutorial_Simplified.pdf>`
```

In addition, a short video illustrating how to import a `*.py` file was provided (also required for the Q1 project).
