# Risk Evaluation

This chapter focuses on the evaluation of risk (Step 4) by applying several different techniques. While the Sections may seem long, the methods are relatively simple and a lot of examples and explanations are provided to illustrate how they can be applied in practice. After this chapter, you will be ready to try all of the practice problems in the Exercise Chapter.

```{note}
The most important part of this chapter is the last page, which introduces several techniques for assessing risk. The other sections provide background information and examples that are useful for understanding the concepts, but are not essential for the exam.
