    "After having gone through the Taylor series, forward and backward Euler, ODE solvers, iterative root finding methods and the stability of implicit and explicit systems, let’s take a look at a simple problem to bring these concepts into practice, all at once. This section shows you what a numerical code for solving differential equations looks like. The code itself is scalable for solving the most complicated differential equations in engineering such as the stress-strain equations, the Navier-Stokes equations and the Maxwell equations. \n",
