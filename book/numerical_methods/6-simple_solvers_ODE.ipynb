    "## Stability\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical stability deals with the impact of approximation errors introduced in simplifying a differential equation (in our case). A numerical method (or a solver) is stable if it does not magnify these truncation errors unboundedly as the computation proceeds. Mathematically, numerical stability can be defined with the following example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a differential equation of the type:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dy}{dt} = f(y, t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "that is being solved using finite time steps. The solution at the time-step $n + 1$ is approximated as $y_{n+1}$ as a function of the solution $y_n$ that was obtained at the time-step $n$. $h$ is the time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{n+1} = F(y_n, t_n, h)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The approximation is numerically stable if, for any initial condition $y_0$ and any time step size $h$, the error between the numerical solution and the true solution remains bounded as $n$ (the number of time steps) increases. In formal terms, there exists a real number $C$, independent of $n$, such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$|y_n - y(t_n)| \\leq C$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s consider a simple example. For $y(0) = 1$, the equation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y' = -\\alpha y \\quad (\\text{where } \\alpha > 0)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "has the solution\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y(t) = e^{-\\alpha t}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Forward Euler, while considering a time-step $h$, one obtains:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{n+1} = y_n - \\alpha hy_n = (1-\\alpha h)y_n = (1-\\alpha h)^2y_{n-1} = \\ldots = (1-\\alpha h)^{n+1}y_0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll notice that the relationship between $y_{n+1}$ and $y_0$ is that of a geometric progression with the constant ratio as $1-\\alpha h$. To prevent a ‘growth’ in the magnitude of the error, the constant ratio should be less than 1, i.e.,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$|1-\\alpha h| < 1 \\implies h < \\frac{2}{\\alpha}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, the explicit Forward Euler scheme is conditionally stable. The above condition must be satisfied (hence, it is a necessary condition) for numerical stability. What implication does this have for numerical solvers in general? It places an upper limit on the time-step that one can use.\n",
    "\n",
    "This also leads to the question: Are there schemes that are not accompanied by a stability criterion? Let’s repeat the above analysis with the Backward Euler scheme (implicit). One obtains\n",

    "$$y_{n+1} = y_n - \\alpha hy_{n+1} \\implies y_{n+1}(1+\\alpha h) = y_n$$\n",

    "Further,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{1+\\alpha h}y_n = \\left(\\frac{1}{1+\\alpha h}\\right)^2 y_{n-1} = \\ldots = \\left(\\frac{1}{1+\\alpha h}\\right)^{n+1}y_0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the only condition that must be satisfied for stability is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left|\\frac{1}{1+\\alpha h}\\right| < 1$$\n",
