**Simpson’s rule**


Simpson’s rule computes the integral of the function f(x) by piecewise fitting parabolas through every set of three consecutive function points and adding the areas under them (see p1(x) and p2(x) in the figure). In formula form:

**Gauss’s rule**

This rule, also called Gauss integration, is used by Finite Element applications, such as ABAQUS, Ansys and Diana, to perform integrations over finite elements to compute internal forces (the forces generated by the materials the finite elements consist of to balance the external applied forces). 
The rule computes the integral of polynomial functions f in the domain [-1,1]. Therefore, the lower and upper bound a and b of the integral must be first linearly mapped onto the [-1,1] domain.
After the mapping has been performed the integral can be computed by evaluating the function f in specific points, Gauss points. Then those function values are multiplied with their corresponding weights and summed.
The Gauss points are the roots of the Gauss-Legendre polynomial of a certain order n. For every of these roots the corresponding weight can be calculated.

In formula form:

where x<sub>i</sub> are the Gauss points and w<sub>i</sub> the corresponding weights.
A table of Gauss points and weights is now presented. The variable n indicates the order of the Gauss-Legendre polynomial used.
