    "## Higher-accuracy Finite-Difference Approximations\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have found expressions with a relative large magnitude error  $\\mathcal{O}(\\Delta x)$ with the exception of the central difference approximation. Sometimes a higher accuracy is desired for which better expressions can be found. The procedure is similar to the algebraic manipulation to find the **forward** approximation of the second derivative: a series of TSE are defined at varying distances from $x_i$ and after algebraic manipulation a more accurate expression is found. For example, the **forward** approximation of the first derivative: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f'(x_i)=\\frac{-f(x_i+2\\Delta x)+4f(x_i+\\Delta x)-3f(x_i)}{2\\Delta x}+ \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta x^2).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The error magnitude has improved to $\\mathcal{O}(\\Delta x^2)$ at the expense of using one more point. The accuracy can be even better by using more points. It is important to note that central differences are more accurate than forward and backward differences when using the same number of points.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The following exercise is about deriving the expression for the forward approximation with higher accuracy."
