# Observation theory

As in other physical sciences, empirical data are used in Civil and Environmental Engineering and Applied Earth Sciences to make inferences so as to describe physical reality. Many such problems involve the determination of unknown model parameters that bear a functional relationship to the set of observed data or measurements. This determination or parameter estimation can be based on different estimation principles.
