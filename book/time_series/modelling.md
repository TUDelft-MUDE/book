# Modelling and Estimation

## Components of time series

## Best Linear Unbiased Estimation (BLUE)

### Model of observation equations

### Estimation of parameters

## Model identification

### Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)

### Least Squares Harmonic Estimation (LS-HE)

## Worked proof: equality of PSD and LS-HE T-test statistics
