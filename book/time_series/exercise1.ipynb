    "**Introduction:** The four components of time series are the trend, seasonality, offset, and noise (white/colored). We use simulated data to show these components here. The observation equation of time series should have the following mathematical representation:\n",
    "$$Y(t) = y_0 + r t + a \\cos(\\omega_ot) + b\\sin(\\omega_ot) + o {u_k(t)} + \\epsilon(t)= y_0 + r t + A_m \\sin(\\omega_o t+\\phi_0) + o {u_k(t)} + \\epsilon(t)$$\n",
    "where\n",
    "- $y_0 $: intercept (e.g. in mm)\n",
    "- $r$: is the rate (e.g. in mm/day)\n",
    "- $a$ and $b$ are the coefficients of the periodic signal \n",
    "- $\\omega$ is the frequency of signal (e.g. cycle/ day)\n",
    "- $o$ is the size of the offset at time instant $t_k$\n",
    "- $\\epsilon(t)$ is the random noise with a given variance which follows a Normal distribution: $ \\epsilon(t) \\sim \\textbf{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we are assuming only a single seasonality and offset component. However, in many practical scenarios, there could be multiple components related to these.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise:**\n",
    "You can simulate your time series based on the priori information provided in the scripts. Plot your results and change the input variables to see the effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The noise follows a normal distribution: use np.random.normal in order to draw random samples from a normal (Gaussian) distribution. Study more for this function here: [normal distribution in python](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.normal.html)*"
