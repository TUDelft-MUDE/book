    "The main goal is to introduce the AutoRegressive (AR) model to describe a **stationary stochastic process**. Hence the AR model can be applied on time series where e.g. trend and seasonality are not present / removed, and only noise remains, or after applying other methods [to obtain a stationary time series](stationarize).\n",

    "## Process definition\n",
    "\n",
    "In an AR model, we forecast the variable of interest using a linear combination of its past values. A zero mean AR process of orders $p$ can be written as follows:\n",

    "$$S_t = \\overbrace{\\phi_1S_{t-1}+...+\\phi_pS_{t-p}}^{\\text{AR process}} + e_t $$ \n",

    "This indicates that parts of the total variability of the process come from the signal and noise of past epochs, and only a (small) portion belongs to the noise of that epoch (denoted as $e_t$). To have a better understanding of the process itself, we consider two special cases, $q=0$ and $p=0$.\n",
