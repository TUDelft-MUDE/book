The introduction, structure of the book and formatting of contents is done under direction of the Editors (Robert Lanzafame, Tom van Woudenberg and Sandra Verhagen), in collaboration with a large team of co-authors and student assistants. Some chapters and pages have additional primary authors who are identified within the book either at the bottom of the first page in a chapter, or at the bottom of an individual page, as necessary. If an author is not listed on a particular chapter or page, the editors may be attributed as the authors.

You can refer to individual chapters or pages within this book as:

As contents of this book may change each academic year, we cannot guarantee that chapter titles and URL's will remain static indefinitely. Therefore, if it is important for you to reference a specific location within the book, we recommend including the complete URL and date of access in your reference.

## How the book is made

This book is created using open source tools: it is a Jupyter Book that uses a number of features from [TeachBooks](https://teachbooks.io/) and is written using Markdown, Jupyter notebooks and Python files to generate some figures. The source files are stored on a public GitHub repository [github.com/TUDelft-MUDE/book](https://github.com/tudelft-mude/book/). View the repository README file or contact the editors for additional information.

## Acknowledgements

This book has many contributors, many of whom are also key members of the MUDE Team:

- xxx
- yyy
- zzz
- MUDE students 

All from Delft University of Technology.

This doesn't include small contributions from various people from within and outside Delft University of Technology.

A better way to see the contributions is to check the [Contributors Page](https://github.com/TUDelft-MUDE/book/graphs/contributors) of the GitHub repository.

A big "thank you" is also due to the Educational Management Team of the Civil Engineering and Geosciences Faculty at Delft University of Technology for giving the MUDE Team financial and organizational support during the early years of MUDE (especially 2022-2024), in particular Hans Welleman, Director of Education of the faculty. Without the freedom and support to experiment with new tools, this book (and [TeachBooks](https://teachbooks.io/) as well!) would not exist!

And in the end, none of this would have happened if it weren't for the quick meeting between Robert Lanzafame, Caspar Jungbacker and Thirza Feenstra in the Fall of 2022 when we considered making our first Jupyter Book and decided to "go for it!" Caspar Jungbacker set up the first book later that year, which is why the book worm in the TeachBooks logo is named "Caspar."
