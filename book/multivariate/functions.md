# Functions of Random Variables

In contrast to earlier weeks, this is where there is dependence between the input random variables.

binary cases are **boring**

Up to this point we have only done binary cases with two RV's (both or either river flooding). In other words, when the problem of interest is based on some set of A and B. What about when this is described as a continuous function? Then we have a (familiar) function of random variables! We will illustrate this case in the next section. **this is where the 1- and 2-random variable pages from 2023 can be included.
