# Multivariate Probability

This chapter started with Antonio converting the notebook and video from last year into a new nb (the first one). The second nb is an exercise to repeat the covariance example from Patricia's lecture with the Berthing Vessel dataset.

The material in this chapter can form the basis of some applied exercises that connect coding and theory. It is still unclear whether these files will be included in the Jupyter Book or in one of the in-class assignments (i.e., *not* in the JB). If you see a use for this material, talk with Robert, otherwise he will incorporate it later in August.
