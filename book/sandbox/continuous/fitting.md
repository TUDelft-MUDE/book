# Fitting a Distribution

In the previous sections, we introduced parametric distributions as mathematical models for the empirical distribution functions of observations. Also, some of the most widely used parametric distributions were presented, such as Exponential or Normal distribution. Those parametric distributions had some parameters which required to be fitted to the observations. For instance, Exponential distribution has a rate parameter ($\lambda$). In this section, the most commonly used methods to fit the parametric distribution functions are presented. Note that it assumes that we know the parametric distribution we want to fit. For instance, fitting an Exponential distribution to a sample of observations.

- L-moments or Method of moments
- Maximum loglikelihood estimator (MLE)
