# Gumbel distribution

Gumbel distribution is widely used to model maximum and minimum values of natural phenomena, such as wave storms or floods. You will learn more about this application in the Extreme Value Analysis section. The PDF of the Gumbel distribution is given by 

$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\beta}e^{-\left( \frac{x-\mu}{\beta} + e^{-\left( \frac{x-\mu}{\beta} \right)}\right)}
$

where $\mu$ is the location parameter and $\beta>0$ is the scale parameter.
