# Fitting a Distribution: Method of moments

The method of moments consists of equating the moments in the observations to those of the distribution we want to fit. This is, there is a relationship between the moments and the parameters of the distribution. Then, if we equate the moments of the distribution to the moments of the observations, we can obtain the values of the parameters of the distribution. Actually, you have already done it in the exercises of the Exponential distribution! Let's see it with another example.
