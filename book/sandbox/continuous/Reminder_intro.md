# Continuous Distributions

```{note}
check what's in the probability chapter and include a short overview about what's there and what's here. Depending on what the random variable chapter includes, this page should show the normal distribution and point out that we will take this concept MUCH further in this chapter. It shows the PDF/CDF, but the theory is in the next section.
```

```{note}
This page needs to explicitly state that we will be using continuous parametric distributions as models, and have a strong link to the modeling terminology and framework that will be added elsewhere in the MUDE book.
