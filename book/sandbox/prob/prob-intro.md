# Probability: an Introduction and Refresher

In this Chapter, a reminder on the basic concepts of probabily theory is given focusing on the following concepts:
- Axioms and rules of probability,
- Random variable, introduced with the Gaussian (or Normal) distribution
- A quick shout-out to discrete distributions

In a separate chapter, we focus on key concepts for applying probability to engineering problems, where our fundamental tools will be continuous distributions and related concepts: probability density function (PDF), cumulative distribution function (CDF), empirical distributions.

## Probability Theory

Fundamental probability concepts are a pre-requisite for this course. While we try to explain key concepts throughout the course materials, you should refer to an appropriate textbook if something is unclear, or if you desire further explanation or mathematical proofs. You have also available the [online course](https://tudelft-citg.github.io/learn-probability/intro_in_toc.html) we prepared for you.
