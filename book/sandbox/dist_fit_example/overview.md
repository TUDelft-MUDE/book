# Distribution Fitting

This chapter started with Antonio converting a notebook from his Q4 course where he downloaded river discharge data and a covariate (sediment discharge in this case) into a notebook for use in MUDE. Then, Robert asked him to make follow-up notebooks where the coding steps were described explicitly.

The material in this chapter can form the basis of some applied exercises that connect coding and theory. It is still unclear whether these files will be included in the Jupyter Book or in one of the in-class assignments (i.e., *not* in the JB). If you see a use for this material, talk with Robert, otherwise he will incorporate it later in August.
