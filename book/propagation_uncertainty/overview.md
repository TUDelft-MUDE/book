# Propagation of Uncertainty

This is an important topic. It has many names. Doesn't matter. In the end there are 2 key elements:
1. a function
2. uncertain inputs for that function

This topic is concerned with mathematically evaluating uncertainty of the output of the function, based on the inputs. Depending on the field, application, day of the week, there will be many ways of doing this. Good luck...
