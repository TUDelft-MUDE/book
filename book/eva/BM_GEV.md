# Block Maxima & GEV

One approach to Extreme Value Analysis is Block Maxima: where a time series is broken into equal units of time, and the maximum observation in each unit is selected. In this chapter we will see that the set of maximum values from each unit (the *samples*) is theoretically linked to the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution.
