# MUDE Materials

```{note} 
The materials in this chapter have been placed here to be able to easily refer back to what we did for Extreme Value Analysis in MUDE, Week 1.2. There were two days, which are called EVA 1 and 2. Each day had a series of videos, along with a Jupyter Notebook, all of which are included in the pages of this chapter. The notebooks have not been altered to match the format of this online textbook, but the videos and slides have been organized and and listed on this EVA 1 and 2 overview pages.
