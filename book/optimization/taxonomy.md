# Taxonomy of optimization models

In this section we will discuss the difference between different types of optimization models:

* Continuous vs Discrete variables
* Single vs Multi-objective
* Convex vs Non-convex problems
* Deterministic vs Stochastic
* Constrained vs Unconstrained problems

Below is an overview of the different types of optimization models and their relationship with each other:

## Continuous vs Discrete variables

The name is self-explanatory for the difference between these two types of variables:

* **Continuous variables:** time, distances, physical properties, etc.
* **Discrete variables:** number of wind turbines, decisions such as doing something or not, type of materials, etc.

Imagine we have a problem to find the optimal wind turbine (WT) farm. In this problem, we have two decision variables:

* $n$, the number os WTs ($10\leq n\leq 50$)
* $d$, the closest distance between two WTs ($15\leq n\leq 100$)

We can clearly see that $n$ is a discrete variable and $d$ is a continuous variable!

## Single vs Multi-objective

It depends on the number of objective functions we need to define to address our problem. Examples 4 and 6 from the last section are good examples of single and multi-objective problems, respectively.

Consider the example presented below of the optimal WT farm. If you define the objective functions to:

* maximize the annual production ($\text{Max}_{n,d} P_{\text{unit}}$)
* minimize the annual maintenance cost ($\text{Min}_{n,d}nC_m$)

These are single objective problems. However, if we consider both objectives at once, we are talking of a multi-objective problem!

$$\text{Min}_{n,d} \{-P_{\text{unit}}; nC_m\}$$

## Constrained vs Unconstrained problems

**Constrained problems:** the solution space is bounded:

* *Feasible region:* only a set of solutions are possible candidates;
* *Unfeasible region:* there is not a possible solution fulfilling all the constraints

**Unconstrained problems:** the solution space is not bounded. All the configurations are possible candidates for being optimal.

Still considering the WT example, if we consider a limited construction budget of 50M euros or a limited annual maintenance cost of 0.7M euros, then we are dealing with a constrained problem. In that case, if the construction or the maintenance costs are higher that the values defined, there is no possible solution!

$$\begin{gather*}nC\leq 50M\\ nC_m\leq 0.7M\end{gather*}$$

## Convex vs Non-convex problems

**Definition:** A convex optimization problem is a problem where all the constraints and the objective are convex functions.

</div>


In the WT farm case, even though the constraints defined above are linear (convex), the objective function is not. Then, it is considered a non-convex optimization problem.

## Deterministic vs Stochastic

**Deterministic optimization:** all the parameters of the optimization problem are deterministic. There is not variability in the problem definition.

**Stochastic optimization:** the definition of optimization problem presents variability or uncertainty. The optimal solution of a possible scenario is not necessarily the optimal solution of another possible scenario.

The problem as defined with the constraints above is deterministic. However, in case the construction, $C$, and the maintenance costs, $C_m$, present variability, the problem is stochastic and we find, for example:

$$\begin{gather*}\text{Prob}(nC\leq 50M)\geq 0.9\\ \text{Prob}(nC_m\leq 0.7M)\geq 0.95\end{gather*}$$
