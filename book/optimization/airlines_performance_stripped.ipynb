    "As we saw earlier, when we ask Gurobi to solve a model without specifying the algorithm, it selects what it thinks is the best algorithm to solve each specific problem. Alternatively, we can tell Gurobi to use a specific algorithm to solve the model. In order to do this, we can change the value of the method parameter within the model. The value of this parameter is set to -1 by default, which calls the concurrent optimizer discussed before. For linear programming problems with continuous decision variables, other possible solution algorithms (available with Gurobi) are: primal simplex, dual simplex and barrier algorithm (which is a specific type of interior point method), with method values of 0, 1 and 2 respectively. letâ€™s see how it works in action.\n",
