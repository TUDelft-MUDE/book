# Optimization

In this chapter you will learn all the basics of optimization. The chapter covers the origins of optimization as well as the main methods that exist to solve these problems. You will learn the following:

- Formulate a mathematical program
- Solve a linear program (LP) through the graphical solution method
- Solve a linear program through the SIMPLEX method
- Solve an integer programing problem with the branch and bound method
- Solve an integer programing problem with a genetic algorithm (meta-heuristic method)
