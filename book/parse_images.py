Script: parse_images.py

Description:
This script processes Markdown (.md) and Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) files listed in a `_toc.yml` file.
It identifies local image references (including MyST `figure` syntax) in these files, copies the images
to a specified folder (`new_images`), and replaces the local image paths with a public URL
(e.g., `https://files.mude.citg.tudelft.nl/<image_name>`).

Key Features:
- Parses `_toc.yml` to extract all Markdown and Notebook files.
- Detects image references in Markdown files (e.g., `![alt text](image.png "title")`).
- Detects MyST `figure` syntax (e.g., `{figure} /path/to/image.png`).
- Resolves image paths relative to the file or project root.
- Handles image paths with optional titles (e.g., `"title"`) in Markdown and Notebook files.
- Skips processing images that are already converted to the public URL.
- Copies images to the `new_images` folder.
- Updates the files to replace local image paths with public URLs.

How to Use:
1. Place this script in the root directory of your project (where `_toc.yml` is located).
2. Ensure `_toc.yml` contains the list of files to process.
3. Run the script using Python: python parse_images.py
4. The script will:
- Copy referenced images to the `new_images` folder.
- Update the Markdown and Notebook files with the new image URLs.

Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- PyYAML (install using `pip install pyyaml`)

Notes:
- Ensure the script is run from the project root directory.
- The `base_url` variable should be updated to match your desired public URL prefix.
- The script handles image paths in the following formats:
  - Relative paths (e.g., `image.png`, `./image.png`).
  - Absolute paths (e.g., `/path/to/image.png`).
  - Paths with optional titles (e.g., `![alt text](image.png "title")`).
