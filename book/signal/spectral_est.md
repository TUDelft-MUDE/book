# Spectral Estimation

## Energy and power signals

We will start by specifying how signals can be classified:

* **energy** signals have finite energy, $E$
* **power** signals have finite power, $P$
* other signals

Definitions of energy and power stem from electrical engineering. Suppose $u(t)$ is voltage across a resistor $R$ producing a time-varying current $i(t)$.

Instantaneous power is defined as $p(t)=u(t)i(t)$, and $u(t)=i(t)R$, so $p(t)=i^2(t)R=\frac{u^2(t)}{R}$. With $R=1\Omega$, the instantaneous power, in Ohm, is given as:

$$p(t)=u(t)i(t)=i^2(t)=u^2(t)$$

Integrating over $|t|\leq T$, we define **total energy** and **average power** as

$$\begin{gather*}E=\lim_{T\to\infty}\int_{-T}^Tu^2(t)dt\hspace{10px}[J]\\ P=\lim_{T\to\infty}\frac{1}{2T}\int_{-T}^Tu^2(t)dt\hspace{10px}[W]\end{gather*}$$

For signal $x(t)$, the **total energy**, normalized to a unit resistance, is defined similarly as:

$$E=\lim_{T\to\infty}\int_{-T}^T|x(t)|^2dt$$

and **average power**, normalized to a unit resistance, as:

$$P=\lim_{T\to\infty}\frac{1}{2T}\int_{-T}^{T}|x(t)|^2dt$$

For real signals, the modulus signs can be removed from the two equations above.

## Parseval's theorem

```{admonition} Definition

Average (normalized) power of signal in **time domain** is the same as the average (normalized) power of corresponding a **signal in the frequency domain**; and similarly for total (normalized) energy.

### Fourier Series

**Average power** of **periodic** waveform $x(t)$ with period $T_0$ can be written as:

$$P=\frac{1}{T_0}\int_{T_0}|x(t)|^2dt$$

Since $|x(t)|^2=x(t)x^*(t)$, we can replace $x^*(t)$ with its complex exponential Fourier series:

$$P=\frac{1}{T_0}\int_{T_0}x(t)\left(\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}X_k^*e^{-j2\pi kf_0t}\right)dt = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}X_k^*\underbrace{\frac{1}{T_0}\int_{T_0}x(t)e^{-j2\pi kf_0t}\,dt}_{X_k}$$

Where we just interchanged the order of summation and integration.

Now, we may write:

$$P=\frac{1}{T_0}\int_{T_0}|x(t)|^2dt=\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}|X_k|^2=X_0^2+2\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}|X_k|^2$$

because $|X_k|$ is even.

In other words, **average power** of a **periodic** signal is simply the sum of powers in phasors of its Fourier Series, or just the sum of the squared moduli of its complex Fourier series coefficients.

```{note}

$X_0$ is signal average and $X_k$ are harmonic components

```

We derived that, for **periodic** signals $x(t)$, the **average power** in the time domain equals the average power in the frequency domain:

$$P=\frac{1}{T_0}\int_{T_0}|x(t)|^2dt=\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}|X_k|^2$$

This is known as **Parseval's theorem**.

### Fourier Transform

Now we can also show that a similar theorem exists to express the total energy in *aperiodic* signals! We start with expressing the **total energy** of the **aperiodic** signal in time and frequency domain using an inverse Fourier transform:

$$E=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}|x(t)|^2dt=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x^*(t)\left(\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}X(f)e^{j2\pi ft}df\right)dt$$

Reversing the integration order:

$$E=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}X(f)\left(\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x(t)e^{j2\pi ft}dt\right)^*df=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}X(f)X^*(f)df$$

We obtain Parseval's theorem for Fourier transforms that can be expressed as:

$$E=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}|x(t)|^2dt=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}|X(f)|^2\,df$$

Energy in the timedomain equals energy in the frequency domain.

### Discrete Fourier Transform

Starting from a discrete, finite sequence of samples, $x_n$, in the time domain, the **average power** start as:

$$
P=\frac{1}{T}\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}|x_n|^2 \,\Delta t
$$

where we have discretized the integral over $x^2(t)$, which then becomes:

$$
P=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}|x_n|^2
=\frac{1}{N^2\Delta t^2}\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}|X_k|^2
=\frac{1}{T^2}\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}|X_k|^2
$$

Note that $X_k$ denotes DFT-coefficients, with $\Delta t$ included ($X_k=\Delta t\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}x_ne^{-j\frac{2\pi}{N}kn}$). The full proof is ommitted (if you think this optional derivation box is long, you don't want to see that one!).

:::

For a sampled signal, with the coefficients $X_k$, obtained through the DFT (with the $\Delta t$ included), the power of the signal, contained in a frequency band of width $\Delta f=\frac{1}{T}$, at frequency $f=k\Delta f$ is:

$$
S(k\Delta f)=\frac{1}{T}|X_k|^2 \quad \textrm{for} \quad k=0,\dots,N-1
$$

and this is actually the **power density** [W/Hz].

#### Periodogram

This turns out to be an *estimate* for the power spectral density (PSD), and it is referred to as a **periodogram** (estimate may be indicated by a hat-symbol, hence $\hat{S}$).

The product $\Delta fS(k\Delta f)$ will, therefore, represent the contribution by frequency band with width $\Delta f$ at a frequency $f=k\Delta f$, to a power $P$ of the signal.

The periodogram, $S(f)$, defined for $0\leq f<f_s$ or, equivalently, $-\frac{f_s}{2}<f\leq\frac{f_s}{2}$, with $f_s=\frac{1}{\Delta t}$ will be given by:

## Power Spectral Density (PSD)

<!-- Over a limited time duration, $T$, one can still use the notion of **power** for energy signals:

$$\underbrace{x_T(t)}_{\text{truncated}}=\begin{cases}x(t):-\frac{T}{2}<t<\frac{T}{2}\\ 0: \text{otherwise}\end{cases}$$

Therefore:

$$P=\lim_{T\to\infty}\frac{1}{T}\int_{-\frac{T}{2}}^{\frac{T}{2}}|x(t)|^2dt=\lim_{T\to\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}|x_T(t)|^2dt$$

and, using Parseval's theorem:

$$P=\lim_{T\to\infty}\frac{1}{T}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}|X_T(f)|^2df=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\underbrace{\lim_{T\to\infty}\frac{|X_T(f)|^2}{T}}_{S(f)}df$$ -->

$S(f)$ represents the **power spectral density**, with $P$ being given trivially (considering the definition of power spectral **density**) by:

$$P=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}S(f)df$$

## Summary

The **energy** and the **power** of a signal are given by:

$$\begin{gather*}E=\lim_{T\to\infty}\int_{-T}^{T}|x(t)|^2dt\\ P=\lim_{T\to\infty}\frac{1}{2T}\int_{-T}^T|x(t)|^2dt\end{gather*}$$

Finally, we derived and gave a formal definition for **Parseval's theorem** which reads (for an a-periodic signal) as:

$$E=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}|x(t)|^2dt=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}|X(f)|^2df$$
